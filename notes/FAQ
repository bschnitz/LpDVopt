These are the most FAQ concerning the Singular Letterplace DVec
Project. (Well, since no one had a question yet, I had to ask
them myself.) It is mostly supposed to be a reference for myself.


0.) Who is responsible?
1.) HOWTO get the Singular Letterplace DVec implementation?
2.) Which is the correct branch?
3.) What about the other branches?
4.) HOWTO compile? 
5.) I want to test it!
6.) Where can I find code examples for GB Calculation?
7.) How to automatically test (e.g. for debugging)?
8.) HOWTO update the LpDVopt submodule?
9.) Where do I find additional Info about Submodules?


0.) Who is responsible?
    Currently Viktor Levandovskyy and Benjamin Schnitzler are in
    charge; great thanks shall also go to Grischa Studzinski. For
    any Questions contact Benjamin Schnitzler
    (benjaminschnitzler@ygooglemail.com), but please be aware,
    that the project is currently in developement, there is no
    support (probably, but You can try...).

1.) HOWTO get the Singular Letterplace DVec implementation?
    git clone https://github.com/bschnitz/LpDVec.git

2.) Which is the correct branch?
    git checkout remotes/origin/sw.nohom.extensions -b sw.nohom.extensions

3.) What about the other branches?
    There are more thant 15 branches. They represent different
    experiments/tests/approaches/developements concerning the
    Implementation. Some successfull/incomplete/failed.
    Developement is currently done mainly in sw.nohom.extensions
    (which is the current working version) and sw.leftgb, which
    is the developement branch for Left GB calculation. 

4.) HOWTO compile?
    Compilation steps are:
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure    # if You want to be able to debug add: --enable-debug
    make
    (pray)

5.) I want to test it!
    I recommend You to get the additional git-submodules LpDVopt:
    git submodule init
    git submodule update LpDVopt
    (now look at Question 6. and 7.)

6.) Where can I find code examples for GB Calculation?
    In LpDVopt/debug/low_memory_tests after having reproduced the
    steps from Question 5.

7.) How to automatically test (e.g. for debugging)?
    After having reproduced the steps from Question 4 and 5:
    cd LpDVopt/debug/
    ./test.sh low_memory_tests

8.) HOWTO update the LpDVopt submodule?
    After having reproduced the steps from Question 5 once:
    cd LpDVopt/debug/
    cd LpDVopt
    git fetch
    git merge master origin/master
    (so this is basically the same, as if LpDVopt was cloned
     without being chained as submodule)

9.) Where do I find additional Info about Submodules?
