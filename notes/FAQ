These are the most FAQ concerning the Singular Letterplace
ShiftDVec Project. (Well, since no one had a question yet, I had
to ask them myself.) It is mostly supposed to be a reference for
myself.


 0.) Who is responsible?
 1.) HOWTO get the Singular Letterplace DVec implementation?
 2.) Which is the correct branch?
 3.) What about the other branches?
 4.) HOWTO compile? 
 5.) I want to test it!
 6.) Where can I find code examples for GB Calculation?
 7.) How to automatically test (e.g. for debugging)?
 8.) HOWTO update the LpDVopt submodule?
 9.) Where do I find additional Info about Submodules?
10.) Where can I find the source code documentation?
11.) How to use the doxygen documentation for the project?


0.) Who is responsible?
    Currently Viktor Levandovskyy and Benjamin Schnitzler are in
    charge; great thanks shall also go to Grischa Studzinski. For
    any Questions contact Benjamin Schnitzler
    (benjaminschnitzler@ygooglemail.com), but please be aware,
    that the project is currently in developement, there is no
    support (probably, but You can try...).

1.) HOWTO get the Singular Letterplace DVec implementation?
    git clone https://github.com/bschnitz/LpDVec.git

2.) Which is the correct branch?
    git checkout remotes/origin/sw.nohom.leftgb -b sw.nohom.leftgb
    Currently there might be done some developement on this
    branch. If Singular does not compile, or tests will produce
    segfaults or wrong output, switch to commit:
    14da17ebbc41d90736fdba93b41402ecf64be455
    If that does not help, contact Benjamin.


3.) What about the other branches?
    There are more than 15 branches. They represent different
    experiments/tests/approaches/developements concerning the
    Implementation. Some successfull/incomplete/failed.
    Developement is currently done mainly in sw.nohom.devel
    and sw.nohom.leftgb. 

4.) HOWTO compile?
    Compilation steps are:
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure    # if You want to be able to debug add: --enable-debug
    make
    (pray)

5.) I want to test it!
    I recommend You to get the additional git-submodules LpDVopt:
    git submodule init
    git submodule update LpDVopt
    (now look at Question 6. and 7.)

6.) Where can I find code examples for GB Calculation?
    In LpDVopt/debug/low_memory_tests after having reproduced the
    steps from Question 5.

7.) How to automatically test (e.g. for debugging)?
    After having reproduced the steps from Question 4 and 5:
    cd LpDVopt/debug/
    ./test.sh low_memory_tests

8.) HOWTO update the LpDVopt submodule?
    After having reproduced the steps from Question 5 once:
    cd LpDVopt/debug/
    cd LpDVopt
    git fetch
    git merge master origin/master
    (so this is basically the same, as if LpDVopt was cloned
     without being chained as submodule)

9.) Where do I find additional Info about Submodules?
    http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules

10.) Where can I find the source code documentation?
     The documentation for the Letterplace ShiftDVec Project is
     yet in developement. A sneak preview on how documentation
     will look like can be found in the developement branch
     sw.nohom.devel . You have to reproduce the steps from
     Question 5. and to switch to sw.nohom.devel . Then you can
     have a look at Question 11. .

11.) How to use the doxygen documentation for the project?
     First make sure to have doxygen installed. Then read
     Question 10., if you haven't done that yet, then follow
     these steps:
     - cd LpDVopt/doc/doxygen
     - doxygen ShiftDVec.Doxyfile
     The documentation can now be found in html/index.html .
